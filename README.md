Assignment: Reproducible Research: Week 4 - Course Project 2
Overview
Weather events cause public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Severe events result in fatalities, injuries, and damage. Predicting and/or preventing these outcomes is a primary objective.

This analysis examines the damaging effects of severe weather conditions (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, floods, etc.) on human populations and the econonomy in the U.S. from 1950 to 2011.

As a result, the analysis will highlight the severe weather events associated with the greatest impact on the economy and population health.

Synopsis
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

In this report,effect of weather events on personal as well as property damages was studied. Barplots were plotted seperately for the top 8 weather events that causes highest fatalities and highest injuries. Results indicate that most Fatalities and injuries were caused by Tornados.Also, barplots were plotted for the top 8 weather events that causes the highest property damage and crop damage.

DATA PROCESSING

Data The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:
Storm Data [47Mb] There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.
